				<h1>Sydney Hardin</h1>
				<p><span class="hidden-xs">I met with Syd Hardin at her home studio at the end of August. </span> Her home is filled with color and art. Her work is also full of color, energy, and incredible detail. Her two small dogs are just as welcoming as Syd was. Syd is a member of the JP Arts Council and is jointly coordinating the brewery site for the Jamaica Plain Open Studios in this September.</p>

				<h2>I know you love pets but why pet portraits?</h2>

				<p>For a long time, I was making feminist commentary art and on the side I would paint people’s pets as gifts for family and friends. People started asking ’Oh you know why don't you *do* that? I bet you could make that a job!” so I threw up an Etsy site in 2013 and the rest is history. It took off better than I thought it was going to; I always wanted to make art my job but I never thought I could realistically make it work… and then suddenly I saw a path to do it. I also love animals obviously. But I also think people are intimidated by art and buying art, and it's easier when it's a subject that's meaningful to them already. I think people can connect with a pet portrait better than with, say, abstract art. Plus, I'm always interested in talking with someone about their pet. It's very natural for me to connect with someone over pets, whereas I think it can be harder to connect over other kinds of art, even portraits of people. </p>

				<h2>Do you think you'll ever stop?</h2>
				<p>I hope not. I think finances may eventually force me to do that but I hope not.</p>

				<h2>And you stopped making the blow up doll paintings?</h2>
				<p>I did because I stopped painting on the weekends. I used to work a full-time day job and then make paintings on weekends and sometimes at night. I was trying to break into the gallery scene and… I wasn't terribly successful. Looking back, I thought I wanted the gallery thing but once I started making pet portraits, I realized that what I actually want to do is paint and it doesn’t matter if it’s conceptual art in galleries or commissions of people’s pets. What I’m doing right now is really enjoyable and feels really rewarding, so I don't feel the need to make giant blow up doll paintings anymore. Also, it’s really nice to have my weekends free again.</p>

				<h3>Is there something with the pet portraits or with your work in general that you're trying to figure out?</h3>
				<p>I think of the pet portraits as a problem-solving activity: I want to capture a specific creature accurately and that means getting the anatomy and personality just right . And in that way, it feels so much easier than conceptual art. It's concrete problem solving: can I make this painting look like reality. I think that this suits my personality more than trying to communicate a feeling or convey a thing that’s upsetting me. But it’s also  why I admire Gail’s art so much: I respect that she can make conceptual art that communicates so much and she makes it look so effortless. I wanted to do that with my old art but I'm not sure I was successful – it certainly didn’t look effortless - and not being successful just feels shitty, like trying to talk to someone through a wall. 
				</p>


				<h2>So you're clearly communicating your ideas right to the client and you're getting the connection which is harder with an abstract?</h2>
				<p>I don't think abstractly, and I don't paint abstractly. I've always been detailed and meticulous with my art. It was the hardest thing about art school because they wanted to break me of that all the time. I learned a lot in art school… but I went back to the detailed, meticulous stuff in the end.</p>

				<h2>What would you like to see happen in your career over the next five to 10 years?</h2>
				<p>I would like to keep this going and I just hope I *can* keep doing this.  I would very much like people to see the value in my work and I would like to be able to better communicate that value more successfully than I do right now.</p>

				<h3>Melissa was talking about how you're not a self-promoter?</h3>
				<p>It's so hard. The problem with doing craft shows is that they force you to be a salesperson, but that's not a natural mode for me.  I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable but I also want to make connections (and sales). I think I rely a lot on my faith in the idea that my work speaks for itself, the idea that the quality and the skill are self-evident so I shouldn’t need to be a salesperson. But that’s not quite how it works and so I want to find that balance. Actually, I suppose that would be my 5-10 year goal: to be showing my work to the right crowd – a crowd that I don’t need to “sell to” aggressively – a crowd that sees the value in my work. But I'm so bad at thinking that far ahead, it kind of gives me emotional hives.</p>

				<h2>When people talk about having an art business, they say it is 90% business and 10% art.</h2>
				<p>I'm thankful this doesn't feel that way yet, but I think (or maybe I fear) that it should and that when it does, you're doing it right. I much prefer spending 80% of my time painting but that's also likely why it's slow going.</p>

				<h3>What does it feel like when you're doing your work, the thoughts and the emotions?</h3>
				<p>When it's going well, when a piece is working, it feels great. I live for the finished product. I love seeing what they become. If I have a good audiobook going and I'm in a groove, I can lose hours painting. On the flip side though, my sketches are the bones and they need to be spot-on to become a good painting. But that part - checking the angles, erasing lines, re-checking angles - it’s excruciatingly slow. I can paint for days but sketching just feels like pulling teeth sometimes. And when a painting isn't working and I have a problem to solve, I feel like my head is buzzing, there’s a very literal physical vibration. I'll force myself to take a step away and go do something else, but I essentially paint in my closet and I'll come home from the gym and go to the studio/closet to change my clothes, see the painting and see, 'Oh that's not right'… and two hours later, my husband will come home, find me in there and be like, ”What are you doing?” and I'll just mutter something like, “It's just not right.”  </p>

				<p>Most of the time it's great and it's working and I feel like I'm in a groove. When it's not working, though I'll feel like I've lost my mind.</p>

				<h3>How can you tell when it's going well? How can you tell when it's not going well?  Is it a physical sensation? Is it a mental thing?</h3>
				<p>That is the perk of the particular work I'm doing. If the painting doesn't look like the photo of the beast I’m looking at, then it's not going well. I can't imagine how Melissa knows when something is right or wrong. It seems much less concrete. I like that I can just look at a photo and tell whether I’ve got it right or wrong. When it's not right it's feels awful and it does drive me crazy, probably to the detriment of my time schedule. But that's also something I tell people when they're considering ordering a portrait: “You get my full undivided attention for a week and a half.” Or my obsession. Whatever works.</p>

				<h3>Do you paint everyday?</h3>
				<p>I do. I try to treat it like a business: I wake up and do the non-painting business stuff until 9, and then I paint until 6 or 7. I know a lot of people who run businesses full time who don't maintain such a structured schedule, but for me, I need to have a strict division in my time. </p>

				<h2>When did you pick up painting?</h2>
				<p>I always made things, but I got really seriously into painting in high school. My school had an AP Art program and that was when I really got into painting through the act of creating a portfolio and I went on from there to study it in college. But I guess it's been my primary medium since I was 14. I did take some detours in college: I focused on printmaking for a little while and then photography but ultimately I came back to painting.</p>

				<h2>Do you ever feel isolated in your studio?</h2>
				<p>Does a bear s*** in the woods?! Yes! Yes I do. And these feelings of isolation really caught me off guard when I started this business. Prior to this, I always worked office jobs and I would spend weekends in my studio. As someone who really values my alone time, it never occurred to me that painting full-time would feel so isolating.  My friend and I call it the Monday Morning Depression: you spend all weekend with humans and then Monday morning rolls around and you’re alone again. In your house. Talking to your dogs. There's a serious sinking feeling on Monday morning when I realize I’m going to be alone all day. It’s gotten better now that I've met more people that do this for a living and I've created coworkers so to speak; at least I have people I can chat with during the day. But if I didn't have pets, I would be really sad.</p>

				<h3>Do your days fly by in the studio?</h3>
				<p>Sometimes. When I'm sketching out a painting they don’t. I can find infinite reasons to get up and go to the kitchen to look through cabinets for nothing when it's sketch time. But when a painting is actually working - and especially if I have a really good audiobook or podcast going - time can definitely fly by.</p>

				<h3>How do you deal with those distractions in your studio?</h3>
				<p>You can see from where I'm sitting that I have my computer in front of me all the time because I paint from digital photos. I actually ended up installing an app that locks me out of Facebook and a couple of other sites during the workday to limit that kind of distraction. I also keep my phone in another room for the same reason.  I do check my email though; I used to try to block my email during the day but 7 o'clock would roll around and it would be like, “You have 500 messages” and then my head would explode. I usually have at least one dog in here with me though and that's the kind of distraction that I like.  </p>

		<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">

				<p>The larger thing that helps me manage distractions is feeling that I have a thing I need to deliver on. Even when I have pieces that don't have deadlines, I like to feel that I'm sending regular updates and sticking to a schedule where the client is getting feedback from me on a regular basis. That is sometimes the thing that keeps me from getting too distracted. I'll think to myself, 'I haven't sent a progress photo in 3 days' and that self-imposed need to feel professional keeps me focused.</p>

				<h3>Can you talk about your tools, the tiny brushes that you use and the type of paint?</h3>
				<p>I cannot live without my number 4 liner brush; it’s basically all I paint with and I go through one roughly every two paintings.. They get kind of destroyed over time because they're so thin; the ends get all dull and they don't make nice clean lines. I have about 5 of those around me at all times. As for the paint, I use zero-VOC latex enamel house paint (the same paint you’d use on your walls at home) and I do not think I could live without this paint at this point. And I say that even though I've developed a mild allergy to it. That's why I'm wearing gloves. I really don't want to give up this paint because I can't imagine painting with another medium. I've become habituated to the house paint and I’ve really developed a style around it – it’s fluidity and liquidy-ness. </p>

				<h3>Where can your work be seen?</h3>
				<p>I have a website it's: <a href="http://www.thepopzoo.com" target="_blank"> thepopzoo.com</a> and I have an Etsy shop <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PopZooSydney" target="_blank"> etsy.com/shop/PopZooSydney</a>.  You can also see me at shows all over New England. Depending on when this comes out, I think the next show will be JP Open Studios, which is my favorite of course. (I’ll be at the Brewery complex.)</p>

				<h2>What would you hope someone would experience when they're looking at your work?</h2>
				<p>Well, first and foremost, I hope that a given client sees their specific pet and their pet’s personality and that they can connect with the reason why they commissioned it in the first place. More generally, if the audience is someone who's not commissioning me - this might sound a little conceited – but I hope that they see the skill and time that I put into my work. I also hope people see my work as having a unique style; the  combo of tiny details and the obsession that goes into those tiny details mixed with a graphic, Pop influence.  My hopes for audience experience is so different from the work I used to do that was the political feminist commentary work; my goal with those was always to make people uncomfortable and I've gone as far to the other side of that as I possibly could with the work I'm doing now.</p>

				<h2>Do you still show the feminist commentary work?</h2>
				<p>I don't. But it's all around me, haunting me, since it’s hung up all over my house.  I hate some of it now honestly; I think some of it is really, really bad. But I do miss the feeling of making people think about something uncomfortable or difficult with my art. But I’ve replaced that with the feeling of making people really happy with my art, and that’s been more rewarding that I ever could have expected.</p>

				<h3>Do you ever think about a piece of work after you sell it?</h3>
					<p>Oh yeah, and it’s a real perk of working primarily on commissions; I never have to feel like I’m sending my paintings off into a void and I rarely have to wonder what happened to a particular piece.  I love it when people send me photos of their pets with their portraits along with these great, heartfelt testimonials. I did not expect to have this amount of personal interaction and updates when I started this business but it’s become one of my favorite parts of the process. Probably because of the general isolation that we talked about earlier.</p>

				<h3>What's the most important thing you would like people to know about your art work?</h3>
				<p>I think it depends on who I'm talking to. Generally, I want people to know that it takes time and attention and focus. I'd like people who are going to buy a portrait to know that they get my undivided attention when I’m working on a piece for them. That said I also get a lot of people who say in response to my work, 'Oh I can't paint, I could never do this, I don't have an artistic bone in my body'. Maybe this isn't true for everyone, but for me it's not that you're born being able to make art. I almost feel like contradicting what I just said about what I want people to know, but it's not a magical “gift” thing, it's practice. I used to not be as good at this as I am now and I’ve improved because I have devoted a lot of hours to it.  I almost feel like I want the people who say, “I could never do that” to know that they could. Sure it's cool that we have this societal myth that artists or musicians are just born with this Gift with a capital G, but I don't actually love that myth. I feel like it keeps people from doing something that they might really love, and it also puts artist in a weird position where we – and by extension our work – are valued as mythical beings and not craftspeople creating a product.</p>

				<h2>What's your favorite question that you get asked?</h2>
				<p>”Are these all <strong>YOUR</strong> pets?” I’m kidding, please stop asking me that.</p>

				<p>My favorite questions actually come from other artists, especially other painters when they come into my booth and ask me technical questions. I really enjoy those artist-to-artist conversations. Or when someone who works in entirely different medium, like a sculptor or a photographer, starts up a conversation about the different ways that artists see things. </p>

				<h3>Do you remember when you first found art and knew it was something you wanted to do?</h3>
				<p>Well, my mom is an art-lover and I was always exposed to art as a child. I drew a lot even when I was little but so do most children. My mom has all the archives of dinosaurs on skateboards and pregnant unicorns that I drew over the years.  Once I got old enough to have thoughts about a career though, I knew that I wanted to be an artist.  I joke on my Etsy Shop description that I wanted to be 4 things when I grew up: A unicorn, a paleontologist, an artist, and a psychologist. Obviously some of those proved to be less viable than others but I think that speaks to what I was exposed to as a child.  As I got older, being an artist and being creative became a part of my identity. Much like people who are good at sports, you identify with the thing that you put a lot of time into, I guess.</p>

				<h2>Do you think that being exposed to that stuff on vacations,  and your mom's appreciation of art influenced your decisions? Or do you think I came naturally?</h2>
				<p>I'm sure. I'm a big believer that it's not nature it's nurture. Before I could even form memories I was encouraged that I make things and that's how habits form. As far as I can remember, I was always really interested in how people made art and how people made something look like reality.  I'm sure that came from early exposure to art and movies and visual language, and the people who were using it well.</p>

				<h3>Do you feel like the larger artist community influences your work?</h3>
				<p>Yeah, although I used to fee that way more so when I was trying to make conceptual work.  I subscribed to Artforum magazine and would try to read up on all the up-and-coming artists in the art world. I'm a little less aware of all of that now. I think being at craft shows has exposed me to more unusual and interesting artists then I had exposed myself to when I was just reading about conceptual artists: woodworkers and people who make mobiles and a million other forms of art that I never even knew about. And I do think they influence me, though I don't always realize it until later on. I'll see someone's color palette at a show and then I’ll see those colors reflected in my next portrait and think, “Oooooh, that’s where that came from.”</p>

				<h2>As your art is shared publicly does it change your initial thoughts on your work, and your impressions of your work?</h2>
				<p>The thing that comes to mind when I see some of my pieces is that I can only see the mistakes I have made. And when someone else likes my work, it helps to take me out of my head space long enough to realize that maybe I should stop worrying about the little errors only I see.  Many times, when I’m looking at my work, I have to stop myself from pointing out all of the imperfections. Is this a part of being an artist I wonder?</p>

				<h2>I think it's part of being a perfectionist.</h2>
				<p>I think that’s what I was supposed to learn in art school: how to own and appreciate happy accidents and blemishes. But I can't let go enough to do that. </p>

				<h3>What do you think the artist role in society is, and your role?</h3>
				<p>I don't want to speak for all artists; I can only speak for myself. But you’ve hit on something that makes me feel guilty: I make pretty art that's cute, and it means a lot to very specific people and I don’t say any of this to disparage that.  But I feel guilty sometimes for not making political art. There's so much privilege inherent to what I'm doing, and I feel discomfort sometimes when I tell people that I make Pet Portraits. Because I used to be able to say 'oh I make political commentary using deflated blow up dolls as subjects’ and that felt good. I liked making art that (hopefully) made people think, but that wasn't a way to make a living (again with the privilege thing). I think it’s important for artists to expose people to thoughts, ideas, concepts and opinions that are outside of the realm of what they normally see and consider. Some of the best art that I've seen - the art that I love - is art that pushes you out of your comfort zone. That's not to say that there's anything wrong with art that makes people happy, but in the current political climate, it feels weird to not be making art that is somehow a comment on how f***** up everything is. How's that for a bummer? </p>

				<p>And at the same time, I don't think that all artists can or should be commenting on difficult topics because we all have different things to say, we all have different skills, and we all have different visual languages. Honestly? I just wish we still had the WPA. I wish that artists were still seen more as integral parts of the economy and of society and that the work of art was seen as valuable the way it was when the WPA was started. Having art all around us is really important and I wish that we as a society valued that more.</p>

				<p>This series is about linking one interview with an artist to the next artist, creating a linked chain of interviews and studio visits. I have asked each artist to suggest the next interview in the series. <br/><br/>Syd talks a little about her friend and fellow artist Gail Bos, Gail's work, and what questions she would have for her.</p>

				<h3>What would you like people to know about Gail?</h3>
				 <p>Just start talking to her, she's so fascinating! She's such an interesting person who has a really interesting life… Generally, I feel like she pays a lot of attention and I'm impressed by her ability be so present and curious. When you start learning about all the different things that Gail does or has done in her life - the countries she's traveled to and lived in, the people that she's met and engaged with – she’s an onion!  </p>

				<h2>What would you like to know more about her work?</h2>
				<p>I have so many questions for her! I want to know where she gets her ideas. I want to know how she manages to work in 15 different media at once and do it all so successfully. Does she work in the studio every day? Or does she ruminate on a thing that is upsetting her or making her angry or something that she wants to comment on and only then go to the studio all fired up? More generally, I want to know more about how she makes art that successfully comments on political and social issues and also manages to make it human-scale. I think her work also goes back to your question of what's the role of artists in society: she's exemplifying how to embody that role, I think and I’d love to know how she sees that role. </p>

				<h2>Is there a specific piece of Gail's that you want to talk about?</h2>
				 <p>I didn't see this in person but she was showing us photos and talking about it at one of the Arts Council meetings. There's installation she did around the emerald necklace and it was about refugees. She set up all these little ants made out of wine corks and grouped them into  little families of wine cork ants fleeing across a kind of border on the ground. She talked about how she would sit back and watch children observe the scene and - without even knowing what refugees are - saying to their parents, 'oh it's wrong that they are being kept out'. This is what I mean about her art’s ability to tackle a big political issue on such a human scale.  Gail is so good at using a seemingly simple visual language to draw out these really intense and complicated emotions and issues. She is very good at figuring out how to make art that children can also understand and engage with. Given her subject matter, that's extremely impressive. I also love that she does gorilla installations and (and I mean this in a very respectful way) she uses her status as a sweet little older woman to get away with some seriously ballsy installations. She’s a badass!</p>

				<h2>What do you imagine her processes like?</h2>
				<p>I can't imagine and that's why I picked her. I imagine that she starts with an idea and the art flows from that idea. But I'm wondering if that's true. I don't know how she decides what media to use or how to communicate an idea. And I want to know more!</p>
